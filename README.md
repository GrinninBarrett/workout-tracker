## Challenges

* The biggest challenge with this application was that at first, the process of seeding the database wasn't working. After some experimentation, I realized it was that the Workout model should be exported from `models/index.js` as an object, even though in this project it is the only model. After making that change, it worked as intended.


## Future Development

* I think it would be better design to allow a user to cancel the creation of a new workout. As it is, if a user clicks "New Workout", a new workout is created at that time, whether they add any exercises to the workout or not. If they choose to abandon the creation of a new workout, maybe because of a mis-click when they intended to add a new exercise to an existing workout (the buttons are touching, after all), they should be able to exit the page or click a "cancel" button to avoid creating a new workout.
