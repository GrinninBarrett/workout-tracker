# ðŸ’ª Workout Tracker

This full stack application uses a [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/) database with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) object modeling and an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) API to allow users to track daily workouts.

## Challenges

* The biggest challenge with this application was that at first, the process of seeding the database wasn't working. After some experimentation, I realized it was that the Workout model should be exported from `models/index.js` as an object, even though in this project it is the only model. After making that change, it worked as intended.
